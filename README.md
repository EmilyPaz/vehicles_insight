## Example Project 1: 

As an Ironhack's student, we are learning how to work in our repositories
We have a function in **vehicles.py** that prints the vehicles.csv shape.

### Steps:

- Import pandas.
- Import vehicles.csv as a pandas DataFrame saved in a variable called df. 
- Use pandas.DataFrame.shape function to print the df's shape.
