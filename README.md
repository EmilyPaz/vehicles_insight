# vehicles_insight :blue_car:

## Example Project 1: 

As an Ironhack's student, we are learning how to work in our repositories
We have a function in **vehicles.py** that prints the vehicles.csv shape on terminal.

### Steps:

- Import pandas.
- Import vehicles.csv as a pandas DataFrame saved in a variable called df. 
- Use pandas.DataFrame.shape function to print the df's shape. 

Also there is a **bonus** part where the functions in **vehicles.py** will print:
- Data Frame's lenght.
- Column's names.
- Column's type.
- Amount of null values per column.
- Minimun and maximun values of numerical columns.
